  REACT: 
    React (also called React.js) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, mainly used to create single-page applications
    (SPAs). It focuses on the view layer of the application and is known for its speed, reusability, and efficient rendering using 
    the Virtual DOM.

1. Components

The entire UI is built using small, reusable pieces called components.
Each component works independently and can be reused anywhere.

2. JSX

JSX = JavaScript + HTML-like syntax.
Makes writing UI easy inside JavaScript files.
 React uses JSX (JavaScript XML), a syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code within JavaScript.
 This enhances readability and makes it easier to define UI structures within components.

3. Virtual DOM

React uses a Virtual DOM to update only the changed parts of the UI.
This makes apps faster and smoother.
 React employs a Virtual DOM, an in-memory representation of the actual DOM. When data changes, React first updates the Virtual DOM, then efficiently 
 calculates the differences and updates only the necessary parts of the real DOM, leading to improved performance.

4. Props

Props = data sent from parent to child component.
Props are read-only.

5. State

State = data inside a component that can change.
When state changes, the UI automatically updates.

6. Hooks

React Hooks allow you to use state and other features in functional components.
Common hooks:

useState → handle changing data
useEffect → run side effects (API calls, timers, events)

7. SPA (Single Page Application)

React apps don’t reload pages.
They update the UI dynamically.
This makes the app feel fast and modern.

Use Cases:
React is widely used for building various types of applications, including: Single-Page Applications (SPAs), Complex
 web applications with dynamic user interfaces, Mobile applications (with React Native), and Server-side rendering (with frameworks like Next.js).
