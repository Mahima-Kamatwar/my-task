Javascript

* Javascript is a high level programming language which is interpreted which support object oriented programming and procedure oriented programming.
 
compiler: errors are check all at once.
          slow in writing.
          execution is fast as it check all error at once.
Interpreter: errors are check line by line.
             fast in writing.
             slow in execution as line by line error check.
 
* syntax to create a variable

scope(var,let,const) variable_name assignment-oprator(=) data/value();

scope : var (public), let, const (protected)

example: let/const laptop

example: const adhar_number 

example: let balance

* datatype 

 primitive 
 number(int, float, short, long, byte, double), string, boolean

 non-primtive
 object, array, function, null, NaN, undefined

 int - -number to +number (no decimal point)
 "some name" - string
 boolean - true/false

* rules to create a variable_name

 1. variable can be alpha-numeric but cannot start with a number.
  box1: correct sequence
  1box: wrong sequence
 2. variable has to be unique (in the same scope) and no space in between.
 3. no special character expection " _ "
 let box_1 : valid

 * statements

 let data1 = "to data here..."; // string
 var data2 = true; //boolean
 const data3 = 1000.5; //number

statements | expresions (=)

simple (output & input), conditional (conditional & looping)

console.log("mahima")

document.write(true)

window.alert("this is some alert")

concatenation : joining of data
example:
        let name = "mahima"
        let age = 20
        let city = "Nagpur"

         console.log("hello! my name is " + name + " and my age is " + age + " i'm from " + city)

        document.write("hello! my name is " + name + " and my age is " + age + " i'm from " + city)

         window.alert("hello! my name is " + name + " and my age is " + age + " i'm from " + city)

 *  input

 let data = window.prompt("enter something")
 console.log("user has sent : " + data)

 let name = window.prompt("enter name")
 let age = window.prompt("enter age")
 let city = window.prompt("enter city")

 prompt will always gets us a string

 console.log("hello! my name is " + name + " and my age is " + age + " i'm from " + city)
 console.log("this is written usign external js file !")

 console.log(document.querySelector("h1"))
